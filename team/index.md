[![Join us]({{ '/images/join-us.jpg' | relative_url }})](mailto:jennie.pouget@camh.ca?subject=Joining%20the%20Pouget%20Lab)

The Pouget Lab is growing! We are actively recruiting graduate students, postdoctoral research fellows, and research analysts to join our group.

We are deeply committed to building a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive lab environment where every member feels safe, respected, and empowered to thrive. All lab members uphold a shared commitment to maintaining a culture of kindness, accountability, and integrity in how we do science and support one another. 

Our team brings together people who are curious, kind, and highly motivated to advance our understanding of psychiatric disorders using multimodal genomic data. Experience in computational biology and biostatistics research, including analysis of sequencing data, are assets but above all we value creativity, collaboration, and a passion for discovery.

If this sounds like you, reach out to learn more about current opportunities!
